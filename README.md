## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javascript


### What I learned

This time i could put in practice my Dom manipulation and general JS skills. I strengthened some concepts that i was forgetting about JS and CSS. I also put in practice my ability to validate forms and build accesible and responsive forms.

### Continued development
I want to keep improving my JS Skills and my CSS abilities. i also want to expand my understanding of these tools so that i can build webpages quickly without getting stuck so much. so i will focus on strengthening my Css flexbox and grid skills and writing efficient and clean js code.
